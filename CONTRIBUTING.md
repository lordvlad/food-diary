- Get a firebase account and create a project at https://console.firebase.google.com
- From the project's settings, get the Web API Key
- Run `npm run configure` and paste the api key. This will also create web push keys and store everything in an `.env` file. This will also create an account at zeit.co for you, so you can deploy the app to staging/production right away.
- Before your first deployment, edit `now.json` and change the alias to a different subdomain, because `food-diary.now.sh` is mine!
- Deploy to a staging environment with `npm run stage` and open the url that pops up in the deployment log.
- Happy hacking :octopus:
